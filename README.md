Tutorial/Google Code-In

Hello Sugar Labs!

I am Tan Chien Hao, and am quite new to programming! I find it really fun though. It has become my hobby!
In future I hope to learn more about AI and Machine Learning, it seems really cool. For now, I am still trying to figure stuff out and code-in seems like a good platform. Thanks! Bye.
